                        <p> I participated in a 24-hour webathon conducted by Velagapudi Ramakrishna Siddhartha
                             Engineering College I embarked on my journey into full-stack development, and it was 
                             truly enlightening! Immensely thankful to my team members . Eager to further explore 
                             industrial-driven projects and keep expanding my skills in this ever-evolving field.
                             Reflecting on an incredible 24-hour webathon experience at Velagapudi Ramakrishna 
                             Siddhartha Engineering College In just one day, we dove headfirst into the world of 
                             web development. The challenges were tough, the hours were long, but the learning was
                              valuable. This journey has ignited a passion for web development in me, and I can't
                               wait to continue exploring this exciting field.The experience taught me the importance 
                               of teamwork, time management, and the power of persistence.</p>
